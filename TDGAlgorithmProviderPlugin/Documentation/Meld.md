##Parameters
Name         | Type
-------------|----------
TARGET_LAYER | Line layer
SOURCE_LAYER | Line layer
TOLERANCE    | Number
OUT_LAYER    | File path
KEEP_NULLS   | Checkbox

**TARGET_LAYER** - The layer to which information should be joined.

**SOURCE_LAYER** - The layer with information to be joined to the target features.

**TOLERANCE** - The search distance for finding matching features. (Given in
units of the coordinate system.)

**OUT_LAYER** - The location to save the output layer (if blank, saves as a
temporary layer)

**KEEP_NULLS** - Whether to keep target features that do not have a match in the
source layer.

##Description

Meld is a tool to associate information from one set of lines onto a set of
similar, but not exactly overlapping lines.

A match is determined using the following logic. For each target feature, a
search is made for any source features within the tolerance distance. If there
are any matches, they are then searched for their distance from
the start, mid, and end points of each target feature. If a source feature
is within the tolerance distance of all three points, it is considered a match.
A tie is broken by the average distance from all three points.

As an example, imagine you received a layer representing all the bike lanes in
a municipality, but the lines don't line up perfectly with the roads layer
so a spaital join won't work. You can use this tool to assign the bike
lane data to the roads that they overlap with.
