#TDG Tools
This is a suite of tools that integrate QGIS functionality and the power of PostGIS to perform operations standard to TDG's analytical processes.
The tools are divided into two major types: QGIS tools, and PostGIS functions. In most cases, a QGIS tool is simply a wrapper to an underlying PostGIS function (or functions). In other words, it would be possible to accomplish most of the same operations available through the QGIS interface within the confines of the PostGIS database. For those of you brave souls who prefer text over a GUI, this is good news.
##QGIS Tools
The QGIS tools are divided into categories based on logical groupings of the types of operations that TDG analysts do on a regular basis.
